# Sitemap

Sitemap is a list of all the pages in a website.

It is used to help search engines index the website.

Nextjs offers a way to generate sitemap.xml file https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap.

Most sites have a sitemap.xml file at the root of the website. This is also useful for scraping since you can get a list of all the pages in the website.
