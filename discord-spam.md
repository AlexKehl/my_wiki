# Discord Spam/DM Tools and info

FAQ ðŸ’¬

- Are proxies required?

Yes, proxies are required. You can't run the tool proxyless.

- Is it necessary to solve captchas?

No, you can opt for a 550-720 second delay between DMs to avoid captchas.
However this will take a lot longer & does not guarrantee that you won't face
captcha's anymore.

- Why only 10 tokens per server?

Discord added a measure a while ago where if >10 tokens DM'd or joined
simultaneously the remainder of the tokens would get captcha & lock very early.
Thats why it is recommended to only use a max of 10 tokens per server, if you
wish to use more make sure they are of mixed dates (max 10 per date). In the
end its also up to trial and error and testing yourself, however a max of 10
tokens per server is a good rule of thumb.

- What is captcha?

Discord frequently throws captchas to combat spamming. For example after
sending out 10 DMs in a small period of time, you'll first hit a 10 minute
ratelimit and then usually a captcha that you have to solve on every single DM
after that until discord thinks you're a human. If your captchas have a high
bot score, your token will get locked after 2-3 solves. On the other hand if
you solve captchas with a low score, captcha will dissapear after anywhere
between 5-20 solves and your tokens will be sending out DMs without having to
solve a captcha.

So if people say capsolver is patched, it means that its returning captcha keys
with a high bot score thus resulting in locks while DMing.

- Best tokens???

Its up to you to test out whose tokens work best for you. FV aged (full
verified) tokens usually work the best. Here is a list of trusted token
suppliers that provide good tokens. Buy a small amount first and test, then buy
bigger amounts.

EV tokens: email verified, limited to only 50 DMs per token. FV tokens: full
verified (email & phone number), limit depends on the token quality but usually
anywhere between 0-1500 DMs per token. Unclaimed tokens: No email or phone
number attached, limit is very low (<10 DMs).

- My tokens keep getting kicked out

Some servers have bots to combat raids, so if you encounter your tokens getting
kicked out frequently consider using higher delays to join. A few minutes
between each join on 1 thread should be sufficient to bypass most of the bots.
Also mixed aged tokens could help.

- Can I make it go faster?

If you want to send out more DMs, the best way to do it is by scaling to
multiple servers. Run more instances of the tool by creating multiple surdm
folders, each a different server & member ids and just redo that for as many
servers as you can find within your niche.

- I keep getting bad results

If you encounter bad results after following everything in this channel make
sure of the following.

    1. Check if capsolver/hcoptcha is patched, read in @surdmupdates or @surdmchat
       if it is patched. It will most likely be posted in one of those channels. You
       can also check by yourself by doing a DM run, if you see locks after 2-3 solves
       on almost all tokens then you can safely tell capsolver/hcoptcha is dead.
    2. Max 10 tokens per server per date, don't exceed.
    3. Check if your message is flagged, do a DM run with the default message
       shipped with SurDM. If you encounter good results with the default message but
       bad results with your own message its most likely that your message is flagged.
       How to unflag? Common sense is your friend here, find words that discord might
       flag (cheats, hacks, etc..) and change your message and keep trying changing
       things until you get good results.
