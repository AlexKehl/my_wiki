## Reagent 

Reagent is a thin layer on top of react which allows to write in clojurescript. 
To get started I used this template


```bash
lein new reagent-frontend myproject
```

This are according to the documentation
`the assets for ClojureScript without a Clojure backend`


For some reason the other template I could not get to work with live reload and stuff.

It appears deps are not in `deps.edn` like in clojure projects but in `shadow-cljs.edn`

## State management
For state management reagent uses [atoms](/clojure.md#atoms).
Every time the atom changes components which use it are re-rendered.

## Http requests
Add `[cljs-http "0.1.46"]` to `shadow-cljs.edn`
Import like `[cljs-http.client :as http]`

And consume like

```clojure
(defn fetch-todos []
  (go
    (let [response (<! (http/get "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos"))]
      (reset! todos (:body response)))))
```
