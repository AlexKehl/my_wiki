## Notes about future improvements

- [ ] Use id generated by frontend for better tracking
- [ ] Reset tradeId from asset when it could not be sent and receives status 'CANNOT_SEND'
- [ ] Better verification of trade urls. Also consider vac bans
- [ ] For logging don't pass function/file name. Use call stack instead
