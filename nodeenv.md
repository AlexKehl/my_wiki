# Nodeenv

A virtual environment for Node.js.

## Usage

```bash
nodeenv --node=18.17.0 --prebuilt env-18.17.0-prebuilt
```

Then 

important: to use --prebuilt flag to avoid building node from source which is much faster.

Then activate the environment:

```bash
source env-18.17.0-prebuilt/bin/activate
```
